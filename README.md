# prism-school-pc

A version of STAPU using the old prism-svn code 

All STAPU things are in the folder demos 

It also has an implementation of sequential single item auctioning

## Tests
**The tests directory is empty because the tests are too big 
The tests location is currently hard coded in CompareSTAPUSSINVI (which needs to be fixed) 
I've tried to upload as many of the tests as I can to a separate git repo using the github large file system:
<https://github.com/fatmaf/stapu-tests>**

If you'd like to run the tests then please make sure you copy them 
You can also look at the repository <https://github.com/fatmaf/generatedTests/> which has the python scripts I used to generate these tests. It also has python scripts that can be used to visualise these tests (just the prism models as a grid)
